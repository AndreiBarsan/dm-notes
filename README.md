ETH Zurich Data Mining Study Nodes
==================================

Purpose
-------
  * These are my personal notes for studying for the Winter 2016 ETH Data Mining
    Exam.
  * They also contain lots of (mostly incomplete) notes on various
    prerequisites, such as linear algebra, convex optimization, signal
    processing, etc.
  * They are by no means complete or correct.
