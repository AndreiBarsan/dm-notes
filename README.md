ETH Zurich Data Mining Study Nodes
==================================

Purpose
-------
  * These are my personal notes for studying for the Winter 2016 ETH Data Mining
    Exam.
  * They also contain lots of (mostly incomplete) notes on various
    prerequisites, such as linear algebra, convex optimization, signal
    processing, etc.
  * They are by no means complete or correct.

Viewing the notes
-----------------
  * You should probably clone the repo and open the notes using
    [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), since it seems GitHub's own
    IPython renderer doesn't get along with LaTeX math very well (especially
    explicit 'equation' environments).
