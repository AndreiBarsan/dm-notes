    " * Semi-automatic procedures to find general and useful patterns in large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    " * **Approximate retrieval**Finding similar elements (similar songs, image search, plagiarism detection, copyright protection, etc.) in giant datasets\n",
    " * Large scale classification (of user behavior, of images, of text, etc.)\n",
    " * Large scale clustering (unsupervised search for clumps of similar users, images, songs, articles, etc.) \n",
    " * Recommender systems (bandit algorithms ($\\epsilon$-greedy, UCB1, LinUCB, Hybrid LinUCB, etc.) and their applications in fields such as news article recommendation and adverting)\n",
    " * Others (monitoring transients in astronomy, spam filtering, fraud detection, machine translation, six degrees of ~~Kevin Bacon~~ separation etc.)\n",

    "## Scale\n",
    " * Example: 10-100 TB of data per sky survey (astronomy)\n",
    " * Archive sizes measured in **petabytes**\n",
    " * Real-time data flows (e.g. computing trends in social network)\n",
